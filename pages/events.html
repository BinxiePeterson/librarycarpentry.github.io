<h2>Carpentries in the Libraries Community Calls</h2>

<p>One of the strengths of The Carpentries is its community and libraries are great places to foster conversations 
  around data and software skills. The series <a href="/blog/2018/07/11/carpentries-in-libraries-community-calls/">launched in July 2018</a> to invite guest speakers to talk about data 
  and software approaches and tools that the community can consider, in their own work, and possibly in the lessons we develop 
  and teach. It is also a chance for community members to discuss their work in Library Carpentry and The Carpentries and to 
  share updates. The 1-hour calls are online and delivered via Zoom. Attendees take <a href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc-community-calls">
  collaborative notes via Etherpad</a> (attendees can add their names, contact information, and updates to the notes) 
  and slides are posted following the calls. The calls generally follow the agenda below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0-20 min - Guest speaker</li>
  <li>20-50 min - Community updates</li>
  <li>50-60 min - Library Carpentry/Carpentries updates</li>
</ul>
