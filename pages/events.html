<h1>Carpentries in the Libraries Community Calls</h1>

<h2 id="time-to-talk-about-data-and-software-skills-in-libraries">Time to talk about data and software skills in libraries</h2>

<p>One of the strengths of The Carpentries is its community and libraries are great places to foster conversations around data and software skills. There are a number of places where our community can have conversations and get involved - these include our Library Carpentry <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby">Gitter channel</a>, and <a href="https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-library-carpentry">Topicbox list</a>. Now there is another option. Starting in August, we will start a monthly online calls series for one hour with the following format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0-20 min - Guest speaker</li>
  <li>20-50 min - Community updates</li>
  <li>50-60 min - Library Carpentry updates</li>
</ul>

<p>For the calls, we will use a <a href="http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc-community-calls">collaborative etherpad</a>. Members of the community can participate by adding their names, contact information, and updates under the “Community Updates” sections. The next 3 calls are listed in the etherpad, details on how to join the calls via Zoom are listed, and we already have speakers lined up to inspire discussions around topics:</p>
