Although Library Carpentry is not tied to any institution or person, it is associated with, and organisationally supported by, <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>, a merger of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry, non-profit volunteer projects and individual lesson organisations whose members teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers.


Library Carpentry has received funding from the <a href="http://software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a>. The Software Sustainability Institute cultivates world-class research with software. The Institute is based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Southampton, and Oxford.

The <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> has funded a <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-85-17-0121-17">two-year position</a> based at California Digital Library to support Library Carpentry development. 

We are indebted to the <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/department-library-information-science/centre-for-information-science">Centre for Information Science</a> at City University London for agreeing to host the <a href="https://cradledincaricature.com/2015/12/01/library-carpentry-in-words-and-numbers-all-code-no-woodwork/">first Library Carpentry programme</a> on November 2015.

Thanks go to the <a href="https://www.nsla.org.au/">National and State Libraries of Australasia</a> (NSLA), who funded an all-capital-cities roadshow in Australia for Library Carpentry in 2017.

Thanks also go to <a href="https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/">Universities New Zealand</a> for funding a 2018 Library Carpentry roadshow for academic libraries in New Zealand.
