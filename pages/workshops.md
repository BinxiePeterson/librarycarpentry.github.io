Library Carpentry develops and teaches interactive, hands-on
workshops for learning core software and data skills of relevance to those in library roles. [Data 
Carpentry workshops](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/) are domain-specific, and focus on teaching skills
for working with data effectively and reproducibly. Our workshops are domain agnostic though datasets used will be familiar to library staff. 

Library Carpentry workshops are in-person events and are 
taught by volunteer Instructors. Our Instructors are [trained in pedagogy](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) with
a focus on creating a motivating and engaging learning environment. 

Our lesson materials are collaboratively developed by our volunteer community. All of our lessons are open source, and are hosted on 
<a href="https://github.com/librarycarpentry">GitHub</a>. 

To request a workshop at your institution, visit the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) workshop request page.

If you're running a workshop, check out our guides for [teaching and hosting](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html) a workshop.
